# TKINTER MVC MULTI-FRAME

Tkinter is a common library for making Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python. In this project, I designed a moderately complex Tkinter project with multiple frames following the MVC design pattern. I wrote an [article](https://nazmul-ahsan.medium.com/how-to-organize-multi-frame-tkinter-application-with-mvc-pattern-79247efbb02b) about it on Medium where I used this project as the example.

To run the project,

1. Clone the project
2. Create a virtual enviroment and activate it.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
